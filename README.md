1.implement the the insortion sort function,initialize the variables valarray and allelements as integers in the function.
2.declared i,presentvalueloc and temp as integers.
3.check for the for loop iterations whether the conditions are satisfied 
4.by using the insertionsort function the loop iterates through array and starts comparing the each and single element with its previous elements and swap them if the condition is satisfied.
5.in the main function we are reading and displaying the elements in the array.
6.the elements are sorted or arranged in order by the insertionsort function.
7.display the sorted array at the end .
